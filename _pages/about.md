I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh working with Dr. Erin Walker in [FACET Lab](https://www.facetlab.pitt.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Langauge Processing and am particularly interested in building conversational educational robots to enhance learning experience for students.

Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer in EC2 Enterprise team at Amazon Web Services, Seattle, where I worked on building services and SDKs to help enterprise customers onboard new workloads on AWS.

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science degree from the University of Southern California in 2019. At USC, I worked at several research projects and served as a research assistant in Social Media Analytics lab and Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT).
