Received a **full scholarship** from the Educational Data Mining Society to attend the Educational Data Mining 2024 ([EDM](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2024/)) conference at Atlanta, Georgia from July 14-17. I will be presenting our accepted work in the Learning analytics and recommender systems session and will also be presenting a poster for my doctoral consortium paper.
